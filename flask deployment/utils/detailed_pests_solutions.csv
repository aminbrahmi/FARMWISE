Pest Name,Scientific Name,Description,Management Strategies
Africanized Honey Bees (Killer Bees),Apis mellifera scutellata,A hybrid of African and European honey bees known for their aggressive behavior. They defend their hives vigorously and can chase perceived threats over long distances.,"Avoid provoking colonies. If nests are near human activity, contact licensed pest control professionals for removal. Public education and awareness are essential to prevent accidents."
Aphids,Aphidoidea,"Small, pear-shaped insects that feed on plant sap and excrete honeydew, which attracts sooty mold. They reproduce rapidly and can spread plant viruses.","Use insecticidal soaps, neem oil, and encourage natural predators like lady beetles and lacewings. Regularly inspect plants and prune infested areas."
Armyworms,Spodoptera spp.,"Caterpillars that travel in large groups and devour crops such as corn, grains, and turf grasses, leaving behind stripped foliage.","Monitor early with pheromone traps, use Bt-based biological insecticides, and apply chemical control during early larval stages. Maintain weed-free fields."
Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs,Halyomorpha halys,"Invasive pests that feed on fruits and vegetables, causing deformities. They also invade homes seeking shelter.",Seal entry points into buildings. Use pheromone traps outdoors. Introduce natural enemies like Trissolcus japonicus (samurai wasp) where permitted.
Cabbage Loopers,Trichoplusia ni,"Green caterpillars that feed on cabbage, broccoli, and lettuce, leaving irregular holes and contaminating produce with frass.","Use floating row covers, monitor using pheromone traps, and apply Bt or spinosad products. Encourage beneficial insects like parasitic wasps."
Citrus Canker,Xanthomonas citri,"A bacterial disease that causes raised lesions on citrus fruits, leaves, and stems, leading to premature fruit drop.",Remove and destroy infected plants. Apply copper-based bactericides during periods of active growth. Implement strict sanitation protocols in orchards.
Colorado Potato Beetles,Leptinotarsa decemlineata,"Beetles with distinctive yellow and black stripes that feed on potato and eggplant leaves, causing severe defoliation.","Rotate crops yearly, handpick beetles and eggs, use neem oil and spinosad. Avoid overuse of chemical insecticides to prevent resistance."
Corn Borers,Ostrinia nubilalis,"Larvae bore into corn stalks and ears, weakening the plant structure and reducing yield.","Plant Bt corn varieties, destroy crop residue after harvest, and implement crop rotation to reduce overwintering sites."
Corn Earworms,Helicoverpa zea,"Caterpillars that damage corn, tomatoes, and cotton by feeding on fruit and ears, leading to reduced quality and marketability.","Use early-maturing varieties, apply insecticides during peak egg-laying periods, and encourage parasitoids and predators."
Fall Armyworms,Spodoptera frugiperda,"Highly destructive pests of corn, sorghum, and turf. Larvae feed in the whorl of plants, stunting growth.","Monitor with pheromone traps, apply insecticides at early larval stages, promote parasitoid insects, and rotate crops."
Fruit Flies,Drosophila spp. / Bactrocera spp.,Infest and lay eggs in ripening or overripe fruit. Larvae cause soft spots and decay.,"Use baited traps, remove and destroy infested fruit, maintain field hygiene, and apply protein bait sprays."
Spider Mites,Tetranychidae,"Tiny mites that create webbing on plants and suck sap from leaves, causing yellowing and speckling.","Spray with strong jets of water, use horticultural oils and miticides. Encourage predatory mites and maintain humidity."
Thrips,Thysanoptera,"Slender insects with fringed wings that feed on plant cells, causing silvering of leaves and spreading viruses.","Use blue sticky traps, apply insecticidal soaps or neem oil, and introduce predatory insects like Orius spp."
Tomato Hornworms,Manduca quinquemaculata,Large green caterpillars that defoliate tomato plants and feed on fruit.,"Handpick larvae, encourage natural enemies like braconid wasps, and apply Bt or spinosad for control."
Western Corn Rootworms,Diabrotica virgifera virgifera,"Larvae feed on corn roots, reducing nutrient uptake and causing lodging of plants.","Rotate crops, use soil insecticides and resistant hybrids. Deploy genetically modified Bt corn and monitor for resistance."
