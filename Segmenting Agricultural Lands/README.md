ðŸŒ¾ Agricultural Land Price Prediction in Tunisia

This project aims to predict the price per square meter (TND/mÂ²) of agricultural lands in Tunisia based on a wide range of features such as location, land size, proximity to the sea or city, infrastructure availability, type of agriculture, and other property characteristics.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build an intelligent and accurate machine learning model capable of:

Estimating the price of a given agricultural land parcel.

Helping stakeholders (buyers, investors, and agencies) make informed decisions about land value.

Detecting price anomalies and supporting fair land valuation practices across Tunisia.

ðŸ§  Methodology
Data Collection & Cleaning
A real estate dataset of agricultural lands in Tunisia was used. The data was cleaned, standardized (e.g., land size in mÂ²), and enriched with additional features extracted from text (proximity, infrastructure, etc.).

Unsupervised Segmentation (Clustering)
Lands were segmented into meaningful clusters using PCA and KMeans, capturing patterns like:

Coastal premium lands

Rural low-cost fields

City-adjacent mixed-value lands
âž• The cluster label was then used as a feature to improve model learning.

Modeling
Several regression models were tested including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost (final model)
The best performance was achieved with XGBoost, reaching an RÂ² score of ~0.71 and a MAE of ~35 TND/mÂ².

Evaluation & Deployment
The trained model was tested on new unseen examples and generalized well across different regions. A pipeline was built using scikit-learn and XGBoost, allowing fast inference for any new land input.

ðŸš€ Example Output
For a land of 2100 mÂ² in Kelibia (Nabeul) near the sea with electricity and vineyard potential, the model predicted:
